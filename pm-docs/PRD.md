Project title: Jacqueline Semerly’s Dog Sitting Services

One-sentence goal of the website: A professional, and trustworthy looking website to send clients to where they can view my services and contact me if they would like to book a dog sitting session, or meet me.

Description: One major way I gain clients is through word of mouth. I would like to make business cards with links to my website so clients can see my reviews, track record, professionalism, and services with transparency (this is as opposed to just handing my phone number out on the street and hoping they trusted our interaction enough to text me OR giving my rover profile, because Rover takes ¼ of my earnings. I’d like my own page now, I’ve been doing this for 5 years)

3–5 core features (written as bullet points or user stories)
    1. Interactive / responsive Nav Bar using Hover effects
    2. A page they can submit a form that I will receive with their inquiry to book (on contact to book page)
    3. List of services and costs: Use my Rover pricing (on Services page)
    4. A page that lists my current reviews (from rover), and allows others to post reviews for me. If we can implement a star / rating system too, that would be cool, even if it’s just a drop down with five options.
    5. Link to my Rover Profile if they would rather book through Rover. (maybe make a note that Rover takes 25% of my profit lol - but I like having this on here, because Rover runs background checks on sitters, so it adds an extra layer of reputability that they can trust me in their home with their pets. I can help write the verbage for this, I want to be very transparent.) https://www.rover.com/members/jacqueline-s-i-will-love-your-pet-like-my-own/?utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=977262825&utm_content=ssp&utm_source=www.rover.com&

List of 4–6 intended pages (e.g., homepage, about, gallery, contact)
    1. Homepage 
    2. Services
    3. About
    4. Contact to Book
    5. Reviews
    6. Gallery

Optional: brief notes on design/interaction (e.g., dark mode toggle)
    - Yes! Toggle dark / light mode switch at the top.
    - See my personal branding sheet: Mostly Use black, grey, and white, only use the greens for accents.https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GAd-uoyC1dVTSNNttLpRUNUok3Dip7spoaZ7-eZHEQc/edit?usp=sharing
    - If you can add cute pet-like designs, like paw prints for bullet notes, or something that would be awesome!
    - Footnote with a place to email me, my linkedin, and my rover profile again maybe.
